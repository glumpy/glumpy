Color, light & texture

Let's continue our OpenGL exploration using the same cube example as in previous
section.

Colored cube
============

Now we'll discover why glumpy is so useful. To add color per vertex to the
cube, we simply define the vertex structure as:

.. code::

   V = np.zeros(8, [("a_position", np.float32, 3),
                    ("a_color",    np.float32, 4)])
   V["a_position"] = [[ 1, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 1], [-1,-1, 1], [ 1,-1, 1],
                      [ 1,-1,-1], [ 1, 1,-1], [-1, 1,-1], [-1,-1,-1]]
   V["a_color"]    = [[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1],
                      [1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1]]

And we're done ! Well, actually, we also need to slightly modify the vertex
shader since color is now an attribute (and not a constant).

.. code::

   vertex = """
   uniform mat4   u_model;         // Model matrix
   uniform mat4   u_view;          // View matrix
   uniform mat4   u_projection;    // Projection matrix
   attribute vec4 a_color;         // Vertex color
   attribute vec3 a_position;      // Vertex position
   varying vec4   v_color;         // Interpolated fragment color (out)
   void main()
   {
       v_color = u_color;
       gl_Position = u_projection * u_view * u_model * vec4(a_position,1.0);
   } """

   fragment = """
   varying vec4   v_color;         // Interpolated fragment color (in)
   void main()
   {
       gl_FragColor = v_color;
   } """

Furthermore, since our vertex buffer fields corresponds exactly to program
attributes, we can directly bind it:

.. code::

   cube = gloo.Program(vertex, fragment)
   cube.bind(V)

.. note::

   You could also have written

   .. code::

      cube = gloo.Program(vertex, fragment)
      cube["a_position"] = V["a_position"]
      cube["a_color"] = V["a_color"]
      
If you look closely at shader source, you'll see a new type of shader variable:

.. code:: C

   varying vec4 v_color; 


This variable is a varying meaning it is interpolated between the vertex and
the fragment stage. We just need to tell OpenGL the color of each vertex and it
will compute the inteprolated color for each fragment, giving us a nice colored
cube.

Outlined cube
=============

We can make the cube a bit nicer by outlining it using black lines. To outline
the cube, we need to draw lines between couple of vertices on each face. 4
lines for the back and front face and 2 lines for the top and bottom faces. Why
only 2 lines for top and bottom ? Because lines are shared between the
faces. So overall we need 12 lines and we need to compute the corresponding
indices (I did it for your):


.. code:: python

    O = [0,1, 1,2, 2,3, 3,0,
         4,7, 7,6, 6,5, 5,4,
         0,5, 1,6, 2,7, 3,4 ]
    O = O.view(gloo.IndexBuffer)

We then need to draw the cube twice. One time using triangles and the indices
index buffer and one time using lines with the outline index buffer.  We need
also to add some OpenGL black magic to make things nice. It's not very
important to understand it at this point but roughly the idea to make sure lines
are drawn "above" the cube because we paint a line on a surface.

Textured cube
=============

Using a texture is rather straightforward. We need a texture (a.k.a. an image)
and some coordinates to tell OpenGL how to display textures. Texture
coordinates are normalized and should be inside the [0,1] range (actually,
texture coordinates can be pretty much anything but for the sake of simplicity,
we'll stick to the [0,1] range). Since we are displaying a cube, we'll use one
texture per side and the texture coordinates are quite easy to define: [0,0],
[0,1], [1,0] and [1,1]. Of curse, we have to take care of assigning the right
texture coordinates to the right vertexor you texture will be messed up.

Furthemore, we'll need some extra work because we cannot share anymore our
vertices between faces since they won't share their texture coordinates. We
thus need to have a set of 24 vertices (6 faces Ã— 4 vertices). We'll use the
dedicated function below that will take care of generating the right texture
coordinates as well as face normals (to be used in next section).

.. code:: 

   def cube():
       vtype = [('a_position', np.float32, 3),
                ('a_texcoord', np.float32, 2),
                ('a_normal',   np.float32, 3),
                ('a_color',    np.float32, 4)]
       itype = np.uint32

       # Vertices positions
       p = np.array([[1, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 1], [-1, -1, 1], [1, -1, 1],
                     [1, -1, -1], [1, 1, -1], [-1, 1, -1], [-1, -1, -1]], dtype=float)

       # Face Normals
       n = np.array([[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0],
                     [-1, 0, 1], [0, -1, 0], [0, 0, -1]])

       # Vertice colors
       c = np.array([[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1],
                     [1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1]])

       # Texture coords
       t = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0]])

       faces_p = [0, 1, 2, 3,  0, 3, 4, 5,   0, 5, 6, 1,
                  1, 6, 7, 2,  7, 4, 3, 2,   4, 7, 6, 5]
       faces_c = [0, 1, 2, 3,  0, 3, 4, 5,   0, 5, 6, 1,
                  1, 6, 7, 2,  7, 4, 3, 2,   4, 7, 6, 5]
       faces_n = [0, 0, 0, 0,  1, 1, 1, 1,   2, 2, 2, 2,
                  3, 3, 3, 3,  4, 4, 4, 4,   5, 5, 5, 5]
       faces_t = [0, 1, 2, 3,  0, 1, 2, 3,   0, 1, 2, 3,
                  3, 2, 1, 0,  0, 1, 2, 3,   0, 1, 2, 3]

       vertices = np.zeros(24, vtype)
       vertices['a_position'] = p[faces_p]
       vertices['a_normal']   = n[faces_n]
       vertices['a_color']    = c[faces_c]
       vertices['a_texcoord'] = t[faces_t]

       filled = np.resize(
          np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3], dtype=itype), 6 * (2 * 3))
       filled += np.repeat(4 * np.arange(6, dtype=itype), 6)

       outline = np.resize(
           np.array([0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0], dtype=itype), 6 * (2 * 4))
       outline += np.repeat(4 * np.arange(6, dtype=itype), 8)

       vertices = vertices.view(gloo.VertexBuffer)
       filled   = filled.view(gloo.IndexBuffer)
       outline  = outline.view(gloo.IndexBuffer)
       
       return vertices, filled, outline


Now, inside the fragment shader, we have access to the texture and to the
color. We can use one or the other or combined them into a single color:

.. code::

   vertex = """
   uniform mat4   u_model;         // Model matrix
   uniform mat4   u_view;          // View matrix
   uniform mat4   u_projection;    // Projection matrix
   attribute vec4 a_color;         // Vertex color
   attribute vec3 a_position;      // Vertex position
   attribute vec2 a_texcoord;      // Vertex texture coordinates
   varying vec4   v_color;         // Interpolated fragment color (out)
   varying vec2   v_texcoord;      // Interpolated fragment texture coordinates (out)

   void main()
   {
       // Assign varying variables
       v_color     = a_color;      
       v_texcoord  = a_texcoord;

       // Final position
       gl_Position = u_projection * u_view * u_model * vec4(a_position,1.0);
   } """

   
   fragment = """
   uniform vec4      u_color;    // Global color
   uniform sampler2D u_texture;  // Texture 
   varying vec4      v_color;    // Interpolated fragment color (in)
   varying vec2      v_texcoord; // Interpolated fragment texture coordinates (in)
   void main()
   {
       // Get texture color
       vec4 t_color = vec4(vec3(texture2D(u_texture, v_texcoord).r), 1.0);

       // Final color
       gl_FragColor = u_color * t_color * mix(v_color, t_color, 0.25);
   } """

Lighted cube
============

For the final stage, we'll add light to our scene. We have once again to
compute everything inside the shader using a light model. We'll stick to Phong
shading but there are many other light models that coud be used.
