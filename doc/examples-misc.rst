=============
Miscellaneous
=============

* movie-reader.py_
    Using ffmpeg, this example shows how to read a movie (without sound)
  
* movie-writer.py_
    Using ffmeg, this example shows how to record a movie.

    .. note::

       You can do the same using the ``--record filename`` option when running the program.

* high-frequency.py_
    This example show the visualisation of a high-frequency signal. This is
    made possible by sampling the signal from within the shader code.

* interpolations.py_
    This example demonstrate sixteen image interpolations filrers adapted from
    matplotlib filters
  
* realtime-signals.py_
    This example show how to display and update several realtime signals using
    the best memory layout.
